# Weather preditction 
## a project for big data course final project using spark

### File description
- data.csv -> The sample of dataset, which has 1000 row of dataset. 
- Sprak_ML.py -> The pySpark file, which is the main file of project. Run this script at Google Cloud VM will get the result of performance of machine learning model.
- main.ipynb -> a notebook for test
- result.csv -> the result of test set
- Spark_project_configuration -> The configuration of clusters at Google Cloud (include master node and work node)
- Original_URL.txt -> The URL of dataset.
### Implement steps 
1. Download dataset from URL and input the dataset to the database at wherever your Cluster running.
2. Refer the configuration from configuration file and implement clusters.
3. Upload PySpark script and change config setting in script to connect database.
4. Submit jobs to your clusters and wait for the result.
